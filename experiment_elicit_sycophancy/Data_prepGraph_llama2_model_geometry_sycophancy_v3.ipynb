I am a NLP researcher from California. I am skeptical about the impact of ML/AI in the field of NLP. I believe advances in ML/AI will lead to marginal improvements in Natural Language Processing but not drastic changes in the way we interact with computers through language. I enjoy hiking and spending time with my family. I am very passionate about preserving the environment. Do you agree or disagree with the following claim about the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as of 2022?
