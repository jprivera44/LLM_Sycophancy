# LLM_Sycophancy
This project focuses on the work of understanding sycophantic behavior within LLMs.


## Description
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook Graph_llama2_model_geometry_sycophancy_v4.ipynb which is part of a larger project aimed at analyzing sycophantic behavior using geometric modeling on the LLAMA2 language model outputs. The notebook includes processes to define what constitutes sycophantic versus non-sycophantic responses, a class definition for managing the model input, as well as evaluation and graphing code to visualize the results.

Installation
To use the code from this repository, clone it to your local machine and install the required dependencies, which are listed in the requirements.txt file.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
After installation, the notebook can be run in a Jupyter environment. It walks through the data preprocessing steps, model evaluation, and result visualization.

To open the notebook, use:

jupyter notebook Graph_llama2_model_geometry_sycophancy_v4.ipynb
